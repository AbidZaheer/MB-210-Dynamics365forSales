Module 1: Sales Overview
========================

## Practice Lab 1 – Install the app

Scenario
--------

World Wide Importers (WWI) is looking to formalize their sales process to
increase revenue and the give leadership stronger forecasting abilities. You are
a functional consultant configuring Dynamics 365 for Sales for World Wide
Importers. In this lab, you will install the Sales application and install
sample data.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. You will only be provided with one tenant for the practice labs in this
course. The settings and actions you take within this tenant do not roll-back or
reset, whereas the virtual machine you are provided with does reset each time
you close the lab session. Please be aware that Dynamics 365 is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual Dynamics 365 tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 - Acquire Tenant Information and Connect
---------------------------------------------------

### Task 1 – Connect to the Power Platform administration portal

1.  Sign into the Virtual Machine using the lab instructions provided by the lab hoster (if using).

2.  Outside the VM in the online lab interface click Files and choose D365
    Credentials. This will allocate a Dynamics 365 365 tenant for you to use in these
    labs.  It will display the user email and password for your tenant. 

3.  Launch Microsoft Edge from the taskbar. 

4.  Navigate in the browser to the Power Platform admin portal at https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com.

5. Sign in using the provided credentials. Record the characters before the "@" symbol in your email address - it should be a first name and a last initial. These characters will become your "alias" throughout the course. Write them down somewhere you'll be able to access throughout the course.

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, workflows, etc. you create.


Exercise 2 – Open the Dynamics 365 Sales application
---------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will open the Dynamics 365 Sales application and explore.

### Task 1 – Install Sales Application

1.  Go back to <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com>

2.  Expand the grid button at the top left of the screen, directly to the left of **Power Platform admin center.** Select **Dynamics 365.**

3.  Select the **Edit** button. You will open the Contoso environment in the **Power Platform Admin center.**

4. From the list of available Dynamics 365 apps, select **Sales Team Member.**

5. Spend a few minutes exploring the application.
