Module 4: Sales Analytics and Insights
==================================

## Practice Lab – Sales Insights

Scenario
--------

One of the primary selling points of Dynamics 365 Sales to World Wide
Importers (WWI) was the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make
sales data immediately actionable for their sales users. You are a functional
consultant configuring Dynamics 365 Sales for World Wide Importers. You have
been tasked with enabling out of the box Insights functionality so that users can use
tools such as the relationship assistant, productivity cards and email
intelligence. In this lab, you will enable Sales Insights and explore the settings.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this course. You will only be provided with one tenant for the practice labs in this course. The settings and actions you take within this tenant do not roll-back or reset, whereas the virtual machine you are provided with does reset each time you close the lab session. Please be aware that Dynamics 365 is evolving all the time. The instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your actual Dynamics 365 tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.
